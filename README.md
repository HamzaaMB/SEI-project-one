## Overview and Concept

Designed by Taito in Japan, Space Invaders hit arcades in 1978 and  is one of the most famous early video games. The game is about defending the Earth from Space Invaders (aliens) by shooting them down before they can land.

My version of the game involves the mighty Zeus and his battles in the sky.
